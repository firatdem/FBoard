## **FBoard**  
A simplified, shareable construction workforce planning board designed to manage manpower assignments across various job sites. It enables your team to assign, search, and track employee status visually on a virtual whiteboard.

This is the public version of an internal tool used to coordinate electricians, supervisors, and contractors in real-world field projects. It supports note-taking, zooming, and filtering features, and stores data in a simple `output.json` file that can be shared via cloud storage like OneDrive.

📤 Excel Export & Live Dashboard (New)
FBoard now includes functionality to export your whiteboard into Excel and publish a live dashboard for team-wide access.

✅ Excel Export
Run the jsonToExcel.py script to convert your current output.json into a structured Excel file:

Job Site Summary – Electrician totals per job site (by skill).
Employees – All employee data (roles, phone, status, certifications, etc.).
Employee List – Grouped by job site for easy crew viewing.
This feature is ideal for internal reporting, emailing stakeholders, or archiving job site rosters.

📊 Live Dashboard Server
Launch a live dashboard using run_dashboard.py, which:

(Optional) Uses a web scraper to fetch the latest CSV from Traqspera.
Converts CSV → JSON → Excel.
Hosts a Dash-based web dashboard that includes:
A bar graph of electrician distribution.
Full job site crew listings.
A request form for suggested changes.
⚠️ Note:
The run_dashboard.py script is currently tailored to our internal setup using Selenium for web scraping.
You must adjust this script if you're using your own CSV/JSON file or a different data source.
If you wish to use the web scraping feature, you must also update credentials and paths accordingly.

🌐 Remote Access via Ngrok
Share your live dashboard with others using Ngrok:

ngrok http 8050
This makes your dashboard publicly accessible with a simple URL — perfect for remote supervisors, team leads, or clients who need read-only access.
